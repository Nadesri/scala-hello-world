New to Scala? Perhaps this starter project can help.

# Scala: Hello World Example

This is a "Hello, World!" example, with some OOP-ness thrown in, for use as a *super simple* starter project.

# Requirements

* Scala
On MacOSX, I suggest getting [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Once you get it, run:
    brew install scala

# Compiling

    scalac HelloWorld

# Executing

    scala helloWorld.HelloWorld
